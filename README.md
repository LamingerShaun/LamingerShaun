## About Me
<sub>Welcome to my github, where I will be working on an uploading projects in both the near and far future. I am a student developer enrolled at MITT
for software development. It's always been a dream of mine to desgin video games, so I hope to work my way to that point in the hopefully not too far future. You
may  notice that my orfile is pretty empty, and that's because I was using an account that wasn't affiliated with my name at all, so I just made this account.</sub>

<sub>I enrolled into MITT because, as I said, it has always been a dream of mine to design video games. I've played them essentially my whole life, and I feel
like they kind of define who I am. I wouldn't be who I am today if it wasn't for those games I played, and I want others to have that feeling too, which is why
I have been, on the side of school, self teaching myself python to work on a game. Once it is completed, I shall upload it in to here, but that'll take a
long while until then.</sub>
